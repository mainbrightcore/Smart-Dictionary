        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Smart Dictionary is a Chrome extension designed to provide instant word definitions and synonyms. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect your data.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Activity:</strong> We collect the text you select on webpages and your interactions with the extension’s interface (e.g., clicks on settings, search queries) to provide definitions and personalize your experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Website Content:</strong> We access user-selected text on webpages to fetch definitions and synonyms from APIs (e.g., FreeDictionaryAPI). No other content, such as images or videos, is collected.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information, health, financial, authentication, communications, location, or web history data.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <p>Your data is used solely to provide Smart Dictionary’s core functionality: delivering word definitions, synonyms, and a tailored user experience. Selected text is sent to APIs for lookups, and UI interactions customize settings like themes or triggers. Data is not used for purposes unrelated to this single purpose, such as creditworthiness or lending.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>User settings (e.g., theme, font size) and word history are stored locally using Chrome’s storage API or synced via opt-in Chrome sync. Data is processed locally on your device, and we implement reasonable security measures to protect it from unauthorized access.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not sell, share, or transfer your data to third parties, except for API queries to fetch definitions (e.g., FreeDictionaryAPI), which involve only the selected word and no personal data. All data remains local or within Chrome’s sync infrastructure.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <p>You can clear your word history or reset settings via the extension’s interface. To disable data collection, uninstall Smart Dictionary. No account is required, so no personal data is retained.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in functionality. Updates will be posted here with a revised “Last Updated” date. Continued use of Smart Dictionary constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
